In Class 106, we learnt about finding the relation between data that is correlated with each other.

In this project we wrote the code to find the correlation of the data and plot it on a graph.

In this project, we saw how data is correlated through a data set of "Student Marks Vs Days Present." We saw that when days present is high, student marks are also high. This type of data we used in our code is called a positive correlated data. 

Then we saw the inversely correlated data between "Cups of Coffee Vs Hours of Sleep"
In this data, we saw that as the coffee consumption increases the hours of sleep a
person gets decreases.

Then we wrote code to calculate the correlation.
